# Simple Timer

A simple emacs timer for simple-minded people like myself.

## Usage

To start a timer, just run `M-x simple-timer` and follow the prompts.

Run `M-x simple-timer-cancel` to stop and remove a timer before it goes off.

## Customization

See the `simple-timer` group in the build-in customize UI.

### `simple-timer-sound-sound-file`

Path to a sound file to play when the timer finishes.  If `nil`, the default system "beep" will be used.
